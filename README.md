# Ecommerce-Site
An Ecommerce front-end made in vanilla JavaScript. Items can be added to and removed from the shopping cart, which uses localStorage to store selected items, prices and quantity. Shopping cart is a modal dialog box that opens after clicking an image. When user selects add to cart button on a product, the info for that product and a button to remove it is added to the shopping cart with insertAdjacentHTML. After a page change, the HTML gets added again from the saved localStorage info after a check that it isn't filled in already to avoid duplication. Still under construction.
